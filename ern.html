                <h1>CHOTTANIKKARA TEMPLE</h1>
                <p>A temple situated in the suburbs of Kochi, that dates back to the 10th century CE, is the famed
                    Chottanikkara Bhagavathy Temple. This is one of the most popular pilgrim centres in Kerala. The
                    deity is believed to possess the power to cure mental illness.

                    The deity is known as Rajarajeswari (Mother Goddess) and is worshipped here in three forms - Goddess
                    Saraswathy in the morning, Goddess Lakshmi at noon and Goddess Durga in the evening.

                    The Makam Thozhal is one of the most important festivals of Chottanikkara temple. It is celebrated
                    on Makam asterism in the Malayalam month of Kumbham (mid-February â€“ mid-March).</p>

                <h1>EDAPPALLY CHURCH</h1>
                <p>Edappally, about 10 km away from the city, is famous for the St. George Forane Church, one of the
                    oldest Roman Catholic Churches in the State. The church, popularly known as Edappally Pally, was a
                    small structure at the time of its construction in 594 AD. In 1080 AD, a bigger church was built
                    adjacent to the old one to accommodate the congregation that had grown greatly in number.</p>
                <p>The church has undergone many renovations since the time of its construction. The picture of the
                    Virgin surrounded by sculptures and angels was integrated with the altar during one such renovation.
                    On the wall behind the altar, there is a painting of Heaven. A statue of St. George mounted on his
                    horse, spearing the dragon, is also seen here.</p>

                <h1>BHOOTHATHANKETTU DAM & RESERVE</h1>
                <p>Bhoothathankettu is among the most picturesque dams in Kerala. It is said the natural fortification
                    of hills and forests that guard the place were built by bhoothams (spirits/ghosts). Trekking through
                    the
                    forests here is an exhilarating experience. A boat ride here is a beautiful way to explore the
                    natural beauty on display. Located nearby is the legendary Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary at Thattekkad.
                </p>

                <p>The two main irrigation projects of Ernakulam district - the Periyar Valley Irrigation Project and
                    the Idamalayar are also located nearby. One can also access pedal boats and cruises in these parts.
                    It is a wonderful picnic spot about 10 km from Kodamangalam.</p>
