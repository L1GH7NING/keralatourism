                <h1>MUZHAPPILANGAD DRIVE-IN BEACH</h1>
                <p>Muzhappilangad Beach is famous for being Kerala's only drive-in beach. At about 7km from Thalassery
                    in Kannur, you have a 4 km stretch of sand that awaits you to simply drive along as you soak in the
                    view of the beautiful Malabar Coast. Along the way, one gets to munch on delicacies from a number of
                    shacks that offer authentic Malabar cuisine. It is often considered a swimmers paradise as the black
                    rocks protect the beach from deep currents. This is a perfect way to relax and soak in this clean
                    and well maintained beach. One can also partake in adventure sports like paragliding, parasailing
                    and micro light flights along with water sports, power boating or a simple catamaran ride.</p>

                <h1>ST ANGELO FORT</h1>
                <p>Built by the first Portuguese Viceroy in India, Don Francesco de Almeida (1505), St. Angeloâ€™s Fort is
                    among the most historic sites in Kannur. This massive triangular laterite structure is flanked by
                    gigantic bastions that make for an imposing sight. It changed hands between the Dutch and eventually
                    the British, who would remodel and reequip it into their primary military stronghold in Malabar.

                    Mopilla Bay and Dharamadam Island are among the primary attractions here. Mopilla Bay is a natural
                    harbour and the fort offers a wonderful view of it along with a sea wall projecting from the fort
                    separating the rough sea and inland water. Dharamadam Island, barely 5 acres in area, is 100 m from
                    the mainland and a favourite haunt of tourists. People come to the fort for relaxing strolls and
                    just a brilliant view of the Arabian Sea.</p>
