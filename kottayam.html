                <h1>ILLICKAL KALLU</h1>
                <p>One of the most popular tourist destinations in Kottayam district is Illickal Kallu, situated on a
                    majestic hill called Illickal Mala.</p>

                <p>There are numerous mountain streams in Illickal Mala, which is 6,000 ft above sea level, and they
                    flow down to form the serene Meenachil River. Each of the three hills has a peculiar shape. One of
                    them resembles a mushroom and hence, its name ‘Kuda Kallu’ (umbrella-shaped rock). The second hill
                    has a small hunch on the side and is therefore called as ‘Koonu Kallu’ (hunchback rock). The third
                    one is called Illickal Kallu as it derives its name from the mountain itself. The steep rock on the
                    top of the hill has a part of its peak shorn off. </p>

                <h1>VAIKOM TEMPLE</h1>
                <p>Vaikom Mahadeva Temple is an ancient temple in Kerala dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple is popular
                    for its annual Vaikathashtami festival. The Shiva Linga here is believed to be from the Treta Yuga
                    (the second of the four yugas, or ages of humankind) and is considered as one of the oldest temples
                    in Kerala.</p>

                <p>The temple architecture is also striking. Though the Sreekovil (sanctum sanctorum) appears circular
                    externally, this is the only temple in Kerala with an oval-shaped Sreekovil. The first chamber of
                    the shrine is built in stone and a single piece of wood. The sanctum sanctorum is built in stone,
                    including the roof. Vaikom Mahadeva Temple is situated in Kottayam district, Kerala. </p>

                <h1>ILAVEEZHAPOONCHIRA</h1>
                <p>Known as the land of letters, latex and lakes, Kottayam is among the most prominent districts in
                    Kerala. Here lies the beautiful valley of Ilaveezhapoonchira, one amongst the many prime picnicking
                    spots in the area. The beautiful hillocks near Kanjar are known to have great trails for trekking.
                    The view in itself is breath-taking. During the Monsoons, the entire place transforms into a surreal
                    spectacle. The terrain changes and one observes Nature at her best. It is highly recommended to view
                    both sunrise and sunset from the valley as the picturesque landscape opens up in a unique and
                    exhilarating way at those specific times. </p>
