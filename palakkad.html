                </h1>
                <p>Malampuzha Garden in Palakkad district is the only rock-cut garden in South India made by Nek Chand,
                    the renowned artist and winner of the prestigious Padmashree Award. The entire garden is made from
                    broken pieces of bangles, tiles, used plastic cans, tins and other waste materials. Also situated in
                    the gardens is the massive Malampuzha Yakshi (female vampire) built in 1969 by Kanayi Kunhiraman, a
                    greatly respected sculptor from the state. It is a spectacular relic of art that we are lucky to
                    still have with us. The flowering beds, fountains and rose gardens along with an aerial ropeway make
                    it a place that instantly soothes your soul.</p>

                <h1>TIPU SULTAN FORT</h1>
                <p>Tipu's Fort, also known as Palakkad Fort, is a beautifully maintained edifice in Palakkad district
                    and was an important military base in the past. Rebuilt by Hyder Ali in the 18th century, the fort
                    was under the Mysore rulers until the British took control of the place. It was then used for
                    providing government services during the British era. Named after Hyder's son Tipu Sultan, it is an
                    important historical destination today.</p>

                <p> The thick laterite walls impress all who view
                    it. People frequent the spot for relaxing walks and jogs. A large ground that lies between the Fort
                    and the Palakkad town hall is an important location for public meetings and important functions.
                    Today it is a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India. It is a preferred picnic
                    spot for everyone visiting Palakkad.</p>
