                <h1>EDAKKAL CAVES</h1>
                <p>A trip to Edakkal Caves is like a journey into our forgotten past. Located 10 kms from Sulthan
                    Bathery, they have provided historians with great information regarding the lives and habits of our
                    ancestors. The caves are two natural rock formations believed to have been formed by a large split
                    in a huge rock. The carvings inside are extremely beautiful. A trek up the majestic Ambukuthi Hills
                    is required to reach these caves. The aroma of coffee stays with you the entire way. It is truly a
                    surreal experience as we step into the palms of history.</p>
